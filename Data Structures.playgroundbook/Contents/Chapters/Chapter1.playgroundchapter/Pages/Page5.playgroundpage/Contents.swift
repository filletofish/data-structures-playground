/*:
 
 Hash collisions are practically unavoidable when hashing a random subset of a large set of possible keys. Therefore, almost all
 hash table implementations have some collision resolution strategy to handle such events. One of the common strategy - separate
 chaining is described.
 
 In this method each bucket is independent, and has some sort of list of entries with the same index (results of hash functions).
 
 In a good hash table, each bucket has zero or one entries, and sometimes two or three, but rarely more than that.
 
 Now I created for you a table with bad hash function: it produces hash based on key length.
 
 **Test it:**
 
 1. Run written to code to see a collision
 2. This is an example of a bad hash function
